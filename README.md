Hi, I'm Kaelan, a final year physics PhD student interested in many questions (in and out of physics) such as ["What is it like to be a bat?"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Is_It_Like_to_Be_a_Bat%3F) and ["Why do isolated quantum systems thermalize?"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenstate_thermalization_hypothesis).

On this page I will publish repositories with the code used for papers and figures since I think copy-paste-edit is an important research tool.

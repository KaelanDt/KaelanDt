Hi :wave:

I'm Kaelan, a quantum physics/computing PhD. I was interested in quantum physics ever since I first encountered it, and then quantum computers were my main interest for ~2 years. Ultimately, I became uncertain of their near-term feasability, because it's just a very difficult engineering problem (thanks [decoherence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_decoherence)). I was also always interested in AI, hence I started to look at machine learning methods for quantum computing and simulation. 

With the recent AI boom, I left quantum in my bookshelf, and am now focused on AI software and hardware.

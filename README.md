Hi! :wave:

I'm Kaelan, a recent quantum physics/computing PhD graduate who's always been excited about the wild world of quantum. The moment I stumbled upon quantum physics, I was hooked, and soon, quantum computers became my obsession for a good two years. But then, I had a reality check - thanks to the notorious [decoherence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_decoherence) - making me question their near-term feasibility.

While exploring the quantum realm, I was also following the AI train. So, I also got curious about AI methods for quantum physics and computation. With my team at the University of Paris, we published a few [papers](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=iM2qRCkAAAAJ) on the topic.

A few months ago, I bid farewell to quantum and am now all-in on building physics-based AI software and hardware at [Normal Computing](https://github.com/normal-computing).

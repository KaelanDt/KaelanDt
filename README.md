Hi :wave:

I'm Kaelan, a freshly graduated quantum physics/computing PhD. I was interested in quantum physics ever since I first encountered it, and then quantum computers were my main interest for ~2 years. Ultimately, I became uncertain of their near-term feasibility, because it's just a very difficult engineering problem (thanks [decoherence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_decoherence)). I was also always interested in AI, hence I started to look at machine learning methods for quantum computing and simulation. I wrote some [papers](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=iM2qRCkAAAAJ) about this along with my team at the University of Paris.

With the recent AI boom, I left quantum to my bookshelf, and am now focused on physics-based AI software and hardware. 

Hey there! ðŸŽ‰

I'm Kaelan, a recent quantum physics/computing PhD graduate who's always been excited about the wild world of quantum. The moment I stumbled upon quantum physics, I was hooked, and soon, quantum computers became my obsession for a good two years. But then, I had a reality check - thanks to the notorious decoherence - making me question their near-term possibility.

While exploring the quantum realm, I also had a secret crush on AI. So, I decided to mix things up and started dabbling in machine learning methods for quantum computing and simulation. With my team at the University of Paris, we published some [papers](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=iM2qRCkAAAAJ) on the topic.

A few months ago, I bid farewell to quantum (for now) and am now all-in on building physics-based AI software and hardware. ðŸš€
